        <h3>10. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h3>
        <p>
            PLEASE NOTE THAT The Terms are subject to change by Erosify in its sole discretion at any time. When changes are made, Erosify will make a new copy
            of the Terms available at the Website and within the App. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the bottom of these Terms.  If we
            make any material changes, and you have registered with us to create an Account, we will also send an e-mail to you at the last e-mail
            address you provided to us pursuant to the Terms. Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately for new users of Erosify Properties
            and will be effective thirty (30) days after posting notice of such changes on the Website or App for existing users, provided that any
            material changes will be effective for users who have an Account with us upon the earlier of thirty (30) days after posting notice of such
            changes within the Website or App or thirty (30) days after dispatch of an e-mail notice of such changes to users who have registered for
            an Account. Erosify may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of Erosify Properties is
            permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s) after receiving a notice of such change(s), you will stop using Erosify Properties. Otherwise,
            your continued use of Erosify Properties constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE AND APP TO VIEW THE
            THEN-CURRENT TERMS.
        </p>

        <h3>11. TERMINATION</h3>
        <p>
            Erosify may cancel, suspend or block your use of Erosify Properties without notice if there has been a violation of these Terms, as determined by Erosify
            in its sole discretion. Your right to use Erosify Properties will end once your registration is terminated, and any data you have stored on the
            Service may be unavailable later, unless Erosify is required to retain it by law. You may terminate your registration at any time. Erosify is not
            responsible or liable for any records or information that is made unavailable to you as a result of your termination of registration. YOU AGREE
            THAT Erosify WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE WEBSITE, APP OR SERVICE. Any limitations on
            liability that favor Erosify will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms for any reason.
        </p>

        <h3>12. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
        <p>
            These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Erosify without
            restriction. Erosify’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such
            provision. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, including, but not limited to, the
            warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
            enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect. A
            printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon
            or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and
            maintained in printed form. All contracts completed electronically will be deemed for all legal purposes to be in writing and legally enforceable
            as a signed writing.
