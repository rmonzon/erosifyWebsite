        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
            PURPOSE OF THE POLICY: This Policy describes how Erosify Inc. (“Us," “We" or <b>"Erosify"</b>) collects, uses and discloses personal information from
            you  when you visit and use the Erosify website and Erosify application on Facebook (collectively referred to as the “Site"). This Policy is only
            applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection
            and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN: We require users to be at least 18 years of age. We do not intend for anyone under the age of 18 to use any of the
            features or services We offer from the Site, and We certainly do not direct any of our content specifically at children less than 18 years of
            age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children's privacy online.
